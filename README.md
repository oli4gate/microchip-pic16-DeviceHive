# microchip-pic16-DeviceHive
Example for a simple device from DeviceHive modified for MPLABX and X8 Compiler instead of MPLAB with HIGH-TECH C

This is the uc simple device example from DeviceHive, I have changed their code to be able to compile it with the X8 compiler in the MPLABX ide.

This code worked, but they have changed their webserver code since. At the time I have connecte it to the beaglebone black.
The PIC16F88 works fine on 3.3V so it was hardware compatible.
